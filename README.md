How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The key to ensuring that my code is functional and secure is to test early and test often. This means that functional tests are done with each separate part of the code. This class has been very useful in teaching how to test for each branch of the project. This becomes especially important for code that has a high degree of interdepence.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
So far in my progress through SHNU, I have been given a list of requirements for each program. I make sure to refer back to these rubrics and requirements often while working on my code. In the future, I will have to need client need documents carefully, while also working with the product managers and clients closely to meet their product needs.
How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to first break the project down into functional groups, and code for each individual requirement. If there is a high degree of interdependence, I will work on the simplest section first and proceed to higher degrees. It is also necessary to test for functionality after each requirement has been met in order to ensure proper execution of the program.
